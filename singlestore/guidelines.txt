Welcome!
For this challenge, you are expected to deliver a website matching the given design spec, using only HTML, CSS & JavaScript.
The design mockups for each page, along with the UI components' interaction states, can be accessed in Figma. ​​​​In order​ ​to​ inspect ​the​ mockups, ​you​ ​will need​ to be logged in to ​a​ (free) ​Figma​ ​account: https://www.figma.com/file/cHqhfP2yz3gj6OBnHTXpLI/Take-Home-Project?node-id=0%3A1
We are looking for attention to detail and expect your submission to look and behave exactly as described in the design specification.

Allowed​ ​Third-Party​ ​Libraries
The​ ​only​ ​third-party​ ​libraries​ ​you​ ​can​ ​use​ ​are:

Font​ ​Awesome:​ ​https://fontawesome.io
​​​The​ ​HTML​ ​may​ ​load​ ​Font Awesome​ ​rather​ ​than​ ​vending​ ​them​ ​locally.


Google​ ​Fonts:​ ​https://fonts.google.com
You may NOT use web frameworks or libraries such as jQuery, React, Angular, Vue, etc., CSS libraries such as Bootstrap, Bulma, etc., or CSS preprocessors such as LESS or SCSS.


Challenge Criteria

Landing page

The​ ​first​ ​page​ ​the​ ​user​ ​will​ ​see​ ​is​ ​the​ ​"Book​ ​a​ ​Demo"​ ​page.​ ​​​This​ ​page​ ​renders​ ​a​ ​form​ ​that requires the user to submit three pieces of information:

Their business email address


The size of their business


Their business’ most important need from a database solution

​​​All​ ​three​ ​fields​ ​are​ ​required, the user should not be able to proceed until each field is populated with a valid value.

Email Address field


The​ ​first​ ​field​ ​(email)​ ​is​ ​a​ ​text​ input ​that​ ​should​ ​validate​ the ​user​ input, checking for ​a​ ​valid​ ​business email.​ The validation should be handled using ​JavaScript​ ​regex.


The form should refuse email addresses from the domains of the most common email providers. We consider the following domains to be invalid:


Gmail


Outlook


Hotmail


Yahoo


Business Size dropdown 


The​ ​second​ ​field​ ​(business​ ​size)​ ​is​ ​a​ dropdown​ ​that​ ​contains​ ​the​ ​following​ ​options:​


​1-10


11-50


51-100


101-250


250-1000


1000+


The field should have the following behavior and interactions:


Clicking the dropdown trigger should display a menu of clickable options


The menu should float above the page content, not push it down


Clicking an option should set its value as the field’s value and close the menu


The currently selected option should be displayed in the dropdown trigger


Clicking outside of the menu should close it and not reset the field’s value


The design of this dropdown is different from the browser default. Your implementation should match the custom design.


Importance Indicator radio buttons


The​ ​third​ ​field​ ​(importance​ ​indicator)​ ​is​ ​a​ ​radio-button​ ​set​ that contains​ ​8​ ​options.​ ​​​ Only one radio can be active at a time. When a radio is activated, the previously active radio should now be inactive.


The design of these radio buttons is different from the browser default. Your implementation should match the custom design.


Form validation

When the user submits the form, its fields’ values should be checked for validity. ​​
If​ the given email address is invalid, or if any form fields are empty:

The user should not be redirected to a new page


An​ ​appropriate error​ message ​should​ ​be​ displayed ​under​ each invalid field


Form submission

Submitting a valid form ​will redirect the user to either a qualified or unqualified page. 
A user is considered unqualified, and should be redirected to the unqualified page, if any of the following options are submitted:

Business​ ​Size​ ​→​ ​1-10


Importance​ ​Indicator​ ​→​ ​Document​ ​Storage,​ ​Full​-Text​ ​Search,​ ​Price

A user is considered qualified, and should be redirected to the qualified page, if they do NOT submit any of the previously mentioned options.

Mobile​ ​Optimization​ ​&​ ​Scaling
The design is intended for use in a web browser on a desktop device only and the centered main content container should be a fixed width (not a percentage of or relative to the window size in any way). 
This means the UI and content do not need to scale down on smaller window sizes (mobile/tablet). If the window width is smaller than the content width, the user should be able to scroll horizontally to view the overflowing content.
Interactions
In​ ​the​ ​design​, ​there​ ​is​ ​a​ ​page​ named ​"Components & States".​ You are not expected to build this page, but instead it ​serves​ ​as​ ​a specification ​of ​the ​various​ ​states​ and interactions ​each​ ​component ​can​ ​have.
Icons
All​ ​of​ ​the​ ​icons​ ​in​ ​the​ ​design​ ​are​ ​from​ ​Font​ ​Awesome,​ ​which​ ​you​ ​are​ ​allowed​ ​to​ ​use​ ​in​ ​your project. The icons used are:

https://fontawesome.com/icons/calendar-days?s=regular


https://fontawesome.com/icons/calendar-check?s=regular


https://fontawesome.com/icons/calendar-xmark?s=regular

The​ ​only​ ​other​ ​image​ ​in​ ​the​ ​design​ ​is​ ​the​ ​logo​ ​which​ ​you​ ​can​ ​download​ ​from https://www.singlestore.com/brand
Everything​ ​else​ ​should​ ​be​ ​done​ ​with​ ​CSS.
What we care about
Visual accuracy – Your implementation should match the design specification perfectly.
Code quality – The code should follow best practices, be properly structured, and be easy to understand. HTML should be valid.
Functionality – The form should behave exactly as detailed in this document and the Figma file.
Your submission will be tested ​in​ ​a​ ​recent​ ​version​ ​of​ ​Chrome​ ​and​ ​Firefox.​ ​​​Other​ ​browsers will​ ​not​ ​be​ ​tested.

Submission
To​ ​submit​ ​your​ ​result​, ​please​ ​package​ ​up​ ​all​ ​relevant​ ​files​ ​into​ ​either​ ​a​ ​ZIP​ ​or​ ​TAR​ ​file​ ​and​ ​send it through Greenhouse via the provided link in the email.
The​ ​submission​ ​should​ ​include​ ​an​ ​index.html​ ​file​ ​which​ ​should​ ​open​ ​in​ ​a​ ​web browser​ ​running from​ ​the​ ​local​ ​filesystem.​ ​​​All​ ​paths​ ​to​ ​other​ ​files​ ​should​ ​be​ ​relative.
